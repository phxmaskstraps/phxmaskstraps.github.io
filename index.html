I'm a 23 year old ASU engineering graduate with a personal 3D-printer doing what I can to help out during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
My printer will be running as needed to supply healthcare professionals with mask straps that reduce ear stress caused by extended use. 
<br><br>
If you would like to order straps for you and your team, I will print and deliver them to any healthcare center in the Phoenix area (Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Mesa, Gilbert, Chandler, Peoria, Surprise, Goodyear), free of charge. 
<br><br>
Contact <a href="mailto:phxmaskstraps@gmail.com">phxmaskstraps@gmail.com</a> with the requested number of straps and delivery location. 
Based on current demand, please limit orders to <u>20</u> straps. 
<br><br>
Thank you for continuing to help those in need!
